go-replicated-log
==========

This project is a simple paxos-based replicated log implementation, mainly for learning purpose.

Code is initially part of my take on the wonderful MIT 6.824 course.

## TODOs ##
  - use glog for controllable logging
  - use tcp connections between peers
  - adaptation of tests (harness tests and partition tests)
  - use jepsen for partition tests
